Transcript for: Which Boxed Chocolate Cake Mix Is the Best? | America's Test Kitchen

[00:00] - I have some good news.
[00:02] I'm gonna give both of you permission
[00:03] to buy box cake mix as
long as it's chocolate.
[00:07] You do not ever, ever,
[00:11] ever have permission to buy frosting.
[00:13] You guys can dig in.
[00:14] You've got four of the eight samples
[00:15] that we did, and some of them
are good, some of them less.
[00:18] So when we put homemade
frosting on a box mix
[00:21] and then compared it to our
favorite recipe, homemade cake,
[00:24] we really couldn't tell the difference
[00:25] 'cause the frosting really
does a lot of work here.
[00:27] So what's the intensity
of the chocolate flavor?
[00:29] Some of them, I would say are
in the, "is this chocolate?"
[00:33] And if you didn't see it,
you might not get there.
[00:36] And some of them have a lot of chocolate.
[00:37] And that's gonna be,
does it have dutch cocoa?
[00:39] It has more oomph than the
brands with natural black cocoa,
[00:44] which is basically extra Dutch
where they reduce the acidity
[00:48] and that basically pumps
up the chocolate flavor
[00:51] is even better.
[00:52] Little teeny chocolate chips,
[00:54] which would give you a wisp of chocolate.
[00:55] Not a bad idea.
[00:56] Some of our favorite
brands have that in them.
[00:59] In terms of how you make
these, they all call for eggs.
[01:03] Some brands call for milk and
butter, others water and oil.
[01:08] Now, besides the fact that water
[01:10] and oil is gonna be much
more convenient than milk
[01:13] and butter, it actually tastes better.
[01:15] The dairy blocks the chocolate flavor.
[01:18] And so besides being fussier,
having to get out the butter,
[01:21] make sure you have milk,
[01:23] it gives you a inferior-boxed
chocolate cake mix.
[01:26] Julia, why don't you tell
me what you're thinking.
[01:29] - Hmm.
[01:29] I like this end of the
table, the C, D end.
[01:32] You mentioned dark cocoa and black cocoa.
[01:34] You can see the difference.
[01:36] So there's no surprise there.
[01:37] They have more flavor,
these two, less flavor.
[01:40] And you said early on
if you closed your eyes,
[01:42] could you tell if it was chocolate?
[01:44] On this one, I'm not sure that I could.
[01:46] I mean, I think I'd get there eventually.
[01:48] One was more caramel than chocolate.
[01:50] B, styrofoam. Kind of just
spongy, not great texture.
[01:54] We get down here, the texture's lovely.
[01:56] - Okay.
Alright.
[01:58] I think Julia has some opinions.
[01:59] Are we in agreement or disagreement?
[02:01] - I'd say mostly agreement.
[02:03] I'm going towards this area.
[02:05] I mean, you know the eye
sees what the eye sees.
[02:08] These are lovely and dark.
[02:09] This one is a bit cakier.
[02:10] And this one, D, is a bit fudgier.
[02:12] - [Jack] Okay.
[02:13] - I would say, I think I have
a slight preference for D.
[02:15] They both have really
nice chocolate flavor.
[02:17] Really surprising actually.
[02:19] Now when it comes to A and B,
[02:21] a lot less of that deep,
rich chocolate flavor.
[02:24] This one, I absolutely detest the texture.
[02:27] It's like if somebody added
sandpaper to the eggs and oil
[02:30] or whatever else is in there,
[02:32] but it has almost an
abrasive texture to it.
[02:35] And then this one tastes like childhood.
[02:38] Mm.
[02:38] That tastes like school cafeteria cake.
[02:41] And there's a place for that.
[02:43] I'm not totally hating it,
but it's not my favorite.
[02:46] Not so great on the chocolate flavors,
[02:47] but this one is industrial cake.
[02:50] This one would be my favorite, D.
[02:51] - Alright.
You like D?
[02:53] Now -
I don't know.
[02:54] Did you C or D?
Do you have a favorite here?
[02:56] - I like 'em both.
[02:57] D, I like the slight
denser, you called it fudgy.
[03:00] I think that's a great descriptor here.
[03:02] With frosting, I actually
might like C a little better.
[03:05] - [Jack] Okay.
[03:06] - Because the denseness of
the frosting might contrast
[03:09] a bit more with the cakier texture.
[03:11] So on its own D, but with
frosting, I'm not sure I'd agree.
[03:13] - D is King Arthur.
[03:16] This is our favorite of
the mail order brands.
[03:18] This is the one that
has two kinds of cocoa.
[03:21] It has the Dutch cocoa, which
we know makes delicious cakes.
[03:24] And then the black cocoa,
which is basically extra dutch,
[03:27] extra flavorful,
[03:28] and gives you that incredibly
dark color and big flavor.
[03:32] It's just a lovely,
intense chocolate cake.
[03:35] C is Ghirardelli.
[03:38] This was our favorite of
the supermarket brand.
[03:40] So these two basically, C
and D, tied in the results.
[03:43] This has the little wisp of chocolate.
[03:45] - I was gonna ask about that.
[03:45] - In addition to the dutched cocoa,
[03:47] they're both lovely options
and make amazing cake.
[03:52] B, the one that you really liked.
[03:53] - Yeah. (laughs happily)
- Yeah, yeah.
[03:54] - Was actually the least
favorite of the tasters.
[03:57] This is the European Gourmet,
[03:59] and it's the only one
made with natural cocoa.
[04:01] - Oh.
[04:02] - And it just doesn't have
that much chocolate flavor.
[04:05] - It's saw dusty.
- Yeah.
[04:06] The texture is not good.
[04:08] - But I don't feel strongly about.
[04:09] (laughs genuinely)
- Not at all.
[04:11] And then finally A,
[04:13] which I think you said was industrial.
[04:16] - Yeah, it tastes like school cupcakes.
[04:18] - Actually, the Betty
cracker wasn't third place.
[04:20] It's not a bad choice.
- No.
[04:21] - There's a nostalgia factor to this,
[04:23] but it really, on the
chocolate scale, can't compete
[04:26] with our two favorites.
[04:27] - Right.
[04:28] So if you had chocolate frosting
[04:29] and that, sure.
Why not?
[04:32] - Sure, why not?
[04:33] It would be even better with C or D.
[04:35] - Yeah.
Agree.
[04:37] - Jack, this was fascinating.
[04:38] Thank you.
[04:39] - You're welcome, Julia.
- Thanks for the sawdust.
[04:41] - You're welcome, Bridget.
